# 🧠 CodSoft Data Science Projects

This repository contains beginner-friendly **machine learning projects** using well-known datasets like Iris, Titanic, Sales Prediction and Credit Card Fraud Detection. The goal is to perform **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, build multiple ML models, and evaluate their performance using appropriate metrics.
